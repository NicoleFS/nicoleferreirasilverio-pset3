My code up until now for the assignment WatchList, it is nowhere near finished though

Peer review of code; reviewed by Jordy Hierck.
Opportunities for improvement written down by me, according to Jordy's commentary

Opportunities for improvement:
  - More commenting throughout the process of writing the code; because I tend to do this at the last moment, I forget to comment parts.
  - Some files are not commented at all, while others just have small parts that are commented; I should be consistent in commenting
  - There should be an initial explanation of the files at the top of each file, I don't have this anywhere
  - I should not forget to reference to the source of my code, whenever I use someone else's code
  - I hardcode too much of the layout of my activities, this might form problems on different phones/tablets etc.
  - There is quite some commented out code still in my files; this should be deleted because it distracts from the important parts of the
  code
  - When using code from a source I should delete all the parts that are not of use for my own programme, this makes my code messy and
  unnecessarily long
 
 Since my code for this assignment is nowhere near finished, and it's just a small amount of code, it's quite hard to find 10 
 separate improvement opportunities. We've tried to find as much as possible.
